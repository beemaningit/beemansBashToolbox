# beemansBashToolbox

Beemans bash toolbox is a small set of scripts that let the user do simple tasks without thinking about it

This is more of a personal project but if you want you can fix or expand the scripts as the toolbox is open source!

Note: the programs ran in the scripts are not affiliated with this project or its maintainer.
